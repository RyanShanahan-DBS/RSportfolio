      <h3>Simulate a MITM attack (ARP Poisoning) using Kali Linux</h3>
      <p>I was tasked to create a simulation of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. MITM attacks are a cyber attack tactic where a potentially dangerous person intercepts communications going on between two parties who should only be directly communicating with each other. The attacker can discreetly monitor and steal potentially sensitive information if they do it successfully. </p>

      <h3>2D Unity Boardgame: Elemental Chaos</h3>
      <p>I have made a digital board game using the Unity engine.
         I chose this project because I had already learned the basics of Unity in my own time and wanted to learn more about it while also
         developing my skills in C#. This was done entirely from the ground up 
         nd I enjoyed using C# in a way that I could visualize the code I had been writing.
